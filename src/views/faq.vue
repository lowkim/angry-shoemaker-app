      <h3>Do you deliver island-wide in Singapore?</h3>
      <p>We do delivery to all the places in Singapore EXCEPT restricted areas such as Army Camps, Cargo zones, Jurong Island, etc.</p>

      <h3>What if nobody is around to pick up the flowers?</h3>
      <p>
        We understand that sometimes things just doesn’t fall in place, and that the recipient may happen to not be at home/office at the given delivery slot. Hence, do let us know in advance if we can pass it to anyone else such as the receptionist, security guard, neighbour, etc.
        If no one is available, and we can not reach the recipient as well, then we will have to bring it back to our store, which can be arranged for self collection; or a re-delivery by the next day, at an additional cost of $10.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I choose a specific delivery time?</h3>
      <p>We would love to cater to the request. Unfortunately we are unable as we prefer to continue giving a more affordable price for you, hence our couriers will deliver by the most efficient route possible, reducing cost, thus reducing price.</p>

      <h3>What are Flower Subscriptions?</h3>
      <p>Instead of receiving your usual magazines/newspaper at your doorstep on a regular basis – you receive lovely flowers!
        <br>Our subscriptions come in a variety of choices to suit your preference:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Regular Subscription
            <br>Choice of delivery for weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Either on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays.
            Choose between Flower Bouquet or Jar.
            If subscription is for jar, please note that we will exchange each jar from 2nd subscription onward so as to keep our carbon footprint to the lowest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Flexible Subscription
            <br>Choice of 4 arrangements/bouquets to be delivered at any preferred dates of your own within a period of 6 months.
            Example: You have 4 family members / friends whom birthdays or anniversaries are upcoming within the 6 months period and you would like to deliver each arrangement to different people, on different dates, and at different locations.
            You will be able to choose between flower arrangement in a jar and flower bouquet. Let us know in advance (at least 1 week before your preferred delivery date) the details ; sit back & relax, while we deliver your surprise for you on the given date!
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Forget-Me-Not Subscriptions
            <br>As Singapore is a busy city, we tend to slip off important dates such as our anniversaries and birthdays. Sometimes even doing last minute shopping when we see “today’s date” (It happens..)
            This subscription allows you to choose your desired dates in advance, and let the Elves take care of it!
            Whether you prefer sending lovely flowers to your loved ones on a regular basis, or to beautify your personal space, it is all up to you to decide! You may even indicate to us your preferred type of colour scheme so that we can curate based on your recipient’s or your own preference.
          </p>
        </li>
        <p>
          One thing for sure, our flower subscriptions are definitely the most value for money compared to purchasing the individual bouquets separately. Furthermore, the price includes delivery and reminder!
          We will inform you at least 1 week ahead (applicable for Flexible Subscription & Forget-Me-Not Subscription) just so in case you may wish to change the delivery date and address.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h3>How do I care for my fresh flowers?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bouquet/Loose/Vase Arrangment:
          <br>When you have received your flowers, do remove their wrapping (if any) and trim the ends of the stem at least 2cm off, at a slanted angle of 45 degree, with a clean and sharp scissors/knife/shears.
          <br>Remove any leaves on the stems that will be submerged in the water.
          <br>Place them in a clean vase (washed) filled with clean cold tap water. The type of vase to be used would depend on the height of the flowers as well as the size of it. Let the flowers sit nicely above the neck of the vase.
          <br>Arrange it to your liking and remember to change the water regularly before they turn cloudy!
          Arrangement in foam:
          Water the foam regularly with fresh water.
          Remove any withering leaves/flowers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Dos & Don’ts</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid placing flowers under direct sunlight, direct wind, or in hot places. Flowers love cool places with some sunlight.
        Do not place flowers near fruits and litted cigarettes.
        If you practice misting flowers directly on their petals, do it at a distance. Too much of water on the flower petals tend to harm the flowers more. Light misting is sufficient. Hydrangea & Orchids on the other hand, tend to prefer being more moist.
        If there is anything that we may have missed out on, please feel free to drop us a call or text to 8768 8832 !
